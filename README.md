# simply-scheme-exercises

The book is freely available here: http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~bh/ss-toc2.html

Yet, if you're like me you need a physical copy, I found a copy on Abe books for a really good deal. Barnes and Noble had the next best deal, so check around because the best deal isn't always Amazon!

If you're not bound by needing a hard copy in front of you, the link will take you right to the website with the book.

This is the best book I have ever read and it's turning out to be a really good introduction to programming in general.  They do say
that they would like to see you move onto SICP afterwards, but I feel like I am going to try to finish all the Exercism projects first.

I also ordered a book called 'Programming in Scheme' by Eisner and may work through that before SICP.  If anyone has finished that book,
maybe they can do a review of it on Amazon or something?
