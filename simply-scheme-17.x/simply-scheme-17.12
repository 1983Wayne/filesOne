;;;  ( SIMPLY SCHEME EXERCISE 17.12 ) Make a procedure that takes a list with sublists (or not) and makes one nice list with it.

(define (flatten lst)
  (cond ((null? lst) '())
        ((word? (car lst)) (append (list (car lst)) (flatten (cdr lst))))
        (else (append (car lst) (flatten (cdr lst))))))
