# simply-scheme-exercises

The book is freely available here: http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~bh/ss-toc2.html

Yet, if you're like me you need a physical copy, I found a copy on Abe books for a really good deal. Barnes and Noble had the next best deal, so check around because the best deal isn't always Amazon!

If you're not bound by needing a hard copy in front of you, the link will take you right to the website with the free book.

This is the first time I've learned anything about programming so it may be that you find simpler, better looking solutions.  It would be cool to see this in about ten years time to see everything again, so that's the main point of this code bank.
