# simply-scheme-4x

My answers to the questions in the book Simply Scheme from lesson 4.  If you hate the code and see areas for improvement, please tell me. This is the first book I have worked through trying to see if I have what it takes to learn how to program and if I stick with it, I wanted to see how the solutions would look to me in a few year's time.  Hopefully the answers are perfect!
